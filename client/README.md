# Development

1. Run `npm install`
2. To start a watch process with Hot Code Reload, run `npm run watch`

* Running `npm run build` will rebuild both CSS and JS files for development
* Running `npm run build-sass` will rebuild the CSS only

3. (optional) Connect CIDER with `cider-connect-cljs`, selecting connection type `shadow` and build `:app`
