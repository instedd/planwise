# Creating a Migration

This script will help you generate a migration file. Migrations are stored in the `resources/migrations` directory. 

For example, running the command:

```sh
$ lein generate-migration add_population 
``` 

will create a file with the following name format:

`yyyyMMddHHmmss-add_population.sql`
